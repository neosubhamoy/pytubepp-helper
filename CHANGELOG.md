> ‚ö†Ô∏è ARM64 binaries are experimental and may not work properly on Apple Silicon Macs (You might see 'Damaged File' warning) it's because the binaries are not signed and Apple Silicon Macs don't allow unsigned apps (downloaded from internet) to be installed on the system (also I'm not planning to sign it soon as it costs 99$/year, which I can't afford RN!). If you want to use pytubepp-helper in your Apple Silicon Macs then you have to [compile it from source](https://github.com/neosubhamoy/pytubepp-helper?tab=readme-ov-file#%EF%B8%8F-contributing--building-from-source) in your Mac
