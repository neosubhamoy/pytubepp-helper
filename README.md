#### **üåü Loved this Project? Don't forget to Star this Repo to show us your appreciation !!**

### üíª Supported Platforms
- Windows 10 (v1803 or later) / 11
- Linux (Debian / RHEL base) (GNOME only)
- MacOS (Maybe Soon - looking for a MacBook user for testing :)

### üìé Pre-Requirements

- [Python (>3.8)](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org)
- [PytubePP](https://github.com/neosubhamoy/pytubepp)
* These requirements can be installed using PytubePP Helper (post installation) if [WinGet](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/winget/#install-winget) is installed in your system. *(for Windows users)

### ‚¨áÔ∏è Download and Installation

1. Download the latest release based on your OS and CPU Architecture

| Arch\OS | Windows | Linux | MacOS |
| :----        | :----   | :---- | :---- |
| x64 | [Download](https://github.com/neosubhamoy/pytubepp-helper/releases/latest) | [Download](https://github.com/neosubhamoy/pytubepp-helper/releases/latest) | N/A |
| x86 | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| ARM | N/A | N/A | N/A |

* **>> Windows:**

2. If you don't have any Pre-Requirements installed first install [WinGet](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/winget/#install-winget). Then restart your Computer.

3. Now open PytubePP Helper (from system tray not from start menu or shotcut) you will see (blue) 'install' buttons. First click on the install button on the right side of 'Python', a cmd window will popup to install Python. after the installation is finished then close the cmd window and now install 'FFmpeg' by clicking on the next install button. after the installation is finished close the cmd window and restart your Computer.

4. Again open PytubePP Helper (from system tray not from start menu or shotcut) and install PytubePP at last. after it finishes you can close the cmd window. Now click on the 'Refresh' button and you will see the 'Ready' message. Then close PytubePP Helper

5. You can now add the [PytubePP Extension](https://github.com/neosubhamoy/pytubepp-extension) in your browser and it should work properly with [PytubePP](https://github.com/neosubhamoy/pytubepp)

6. PRO TIPS:
- Make sure PytubePP Helper is always running in the background (system tray) otherwise PytubePP Extension will not work properly.
- Always open PytubePP Helper from system tray if it's already running. if you open PytubePP Helper from start menu or shotcut when PytubePP Helper is already running in system tray then two instances of PytubePP Helper will run on the same time which may cause the app to malfunction!
- PytubePP Helper by default always autostarts itself when Windows starts. Make sure autosart is not disabled for PytubePP Helper in Task Manager (Startup apps tab)

* **>> Linux:**

   > NOTE: Not all Debian / RHEL based distros are supported. Supported distros are: debian, ubuntu (tested on v24.04 LTS), pop, kali, rhel, fedora (tested on v40), centos, rocky. If your distro is not in the supported list it doesn't mean that 'the app will not run at all', so, test it yourself and if it doesn't work then you can request us to add support for your distro via creating a github issue.

   > Sandboxed Browsers may not work properly (eg: Flatpak, Snaps) (have issue with: Browser NativeMessaging API [read here](https://github.com/flatpak/xdg-desktop-portal/issues/655))

2. For linux users Pre-Requirements are mostly fulfilled as 'Python' is pre installed in most linux distros and 'FFmpeg' is auto installed as a dependency  while installing the .deb / .rpm package. You just need to install 'PytubePP' manually by clicking the blue 'install' button opening pytubepp-helper. Now click on the 'Refresh' button and you will see the 'Ready' message. Then close PytubePP Helper.

   > Always make sure your system packages are up-to-date (you may face issues otherwise, the app may not open at all)

   > If you are facing issues with installing 'libwebkit2gtk-4.0' as dependency of pytubepp-helper in Ubuntu 24.04 LTS follow this [guide](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/9662)

   > 'AppIndicator' feature must be enabled for seemless experiance with pytubepp-helper. If your distro doesn't support this by default (eg: fedora) then you need to enable it for your GNOME desktop environment manually, using a GNOME shell extension: [AppIndicator and KStatusNotifierItem Support](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/615/appindicator-support/)

3. You can now add the [PytubePP Extension](https://github.com/neosubhamoy/pytubepp-extension) in your browser and it should work properly with [PytubePP](https://github.com/neosubhamoy/pytubepp)

4. PRO TIPS:
- Make sure PytubePP Helper is always running in the background (Appindicator) otherwise PytubePP Extension will not work properly.
- Always open PytubePP Helper from Appindicator if it's already running. if you open PytubePP Helper from programs menu or shotcut when PytubePP Helper is already running in Appindicator then two instances of PytubePP Helper will run on the same time which may cause the app to malfunction!
- PytubePP Helper by default always autostarts itself when Linux Distro starts. Make sure autosart is not disabled for PytubePP Helper in your distro's Startup Manager / Applications

### ‚ùî How It Works

- PytubePP Helper is an intermediate communicator between PytubePP Extension and Pytube Post Processor CLI interface. It is used as a bridge to estblish communication between the System Shell / CMD and Browser Extension, as a Browser Extension can not directly talk (execute commands) with System Shell / CMD for security reasons. Browser Extensions are isolated from the system too, the only way they can communicate with the system (native apps only) is nativeMessaging API provided by Chrome (other Browsers provides it too). So, PytubePP Helper uses that API to communicate with the Browser Extension and recives it's requests and processes the data from PytubePP CLI then genrates a response and sends it to the Browser Extension. For further understanding view the system design diagram of PytubePP Helper app below:
